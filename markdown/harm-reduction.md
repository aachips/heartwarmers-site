# Moving Beyond Stigma: Understanding Harm Reduction

Harm reduction is a public health approach that prioritizes safety and well-being for people who use substances. It focuses on minimizing the negative consequences associated with substance use, rather than solely aiming for abstinence. The lecture addressed some common misconceptions surrounding harm reduction practices, particularly needle exchange programs. These programs provide sterile syringes to prevent the spread of bloodborne diseases like Hepatitis C and HIV.

## Protecting Ourselves and Our Neighbors

The talk unpacked the importance of harm reduction extending beyond substance use. It explored ways we can reduce harm faced by vulnerable populations in our communities. This might involve advocating for better access to healthcare, providing support for people experiencing homelessness, or simply practicing empathy and understanding towards those facing struggles.

## Dispelling Myths, Sharing Resources

The lecture shed light on the realities of bloodborne illnesses like Hepatitis and Syphilis. It highlighted the importance of getting tested and the readily available resources for treatment and prevention of HIV and AIDS.

## Building a More Compassionate Community

By embracing harm reduction principles, we can create a safer and healthier Western North Carolina for everyone. This means dismantling stigma, offering support, and ensuring access to essential resources.
