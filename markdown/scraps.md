  <h3>About Heartwarmers Project</h3>
    <p>
      Born out of necessity, the Heartwarmers Project originated from a simple trick utilized by a formerly homeless individual to survive harsh winter nights. By placing a hot water bottle inside their clothing, the creator experienced increased warmth and
      reduced the likelihood of frostbite or hypothermia. Following extensive research and consultation with experts, the Heartwarmers Project evolved into its current form, benefitting countless individuals since its inception.
    </p>
    <h3>How Businesses Can Help</h3>
    <p>
      Local businesses are invited to join forces with the Heartwarmers Project to extend its reach and maximize impact. By volunteering as designated pick-up and drop-off locations, companies can exhibit their dedication to giving back to the community and
      fostering a welcoming environment for those less fortunate.
    </p>
    <h3>Impact of the Project</h3>
    <p>
      The Heartwarmers Project saves lives. By supplying a steady source of warmth, the project enables homeless individuals to confront the brutal winter months with renewed vigor. Furthermore, by elevating awareness around the struggles faced by
      the homeless populace, the Heartwarmers Project seeks to cultivate empathy and galvanize collective action.

                <h3>Qualities of an Unsafe Heartwarmer Bottle</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Crafted from fragile, melting-prone materials (low-quality plastic, etc.).</li>
                  <li>Has a weak or inconsistent seal prone to leaking.</li>
                  <li>Retains heat internally, merely serving as a thermal barrier (thermos-like).</li>
                  <li>Diminutively sized, incapable of retaining heat adequately.</li>
                </ul>

        <p>
          Popular recommended bottles include Nalgene, double-walled stainless steel, and glass-lined metal. Always test the bottle's seal and evaluate its external radiation capabilities to guarantee efficiency and safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Metal bottles may necessitate coverage with a sock or glove to prevent skin burns. Be cautious when using certain metal types susceptible to releasing toxic fumes when subjected to extremely high temperatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Nalgene remains a popular choice, bear in mind that some metal variants will function equally effectively. Irrespective of the chosen material, consistently examine the bottle's seal and heat emission characteristics to assure suitability.
